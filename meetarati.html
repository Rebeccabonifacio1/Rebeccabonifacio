<h1 class="text-center"> Meet Arati </h1>
<p> Dr. Arati Kreibich is a Councilmember in Glen Rock, a neuroscientist, and a mom. She immigrated to the U.S. when she was 11 years old with her parents and two younger brothers because they believed in the promise of America. </p> 

<p> Growing up, Arati always wanted to be a scientist. She earned her PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 2005 and became a neuroscientist. Her research focus on opiate addiction and her experience working with pharmaceutical companies gave her an unvarnished look at the serious shortcomings of for-profit healthcare. While pursuing her doctorate and career, she started a family with her husband Thomas, a neurologist. Her experience with limited parental leave crystallized for Arati the lack of support for working mothers. </p>

<p> The 2016 election was a defining event for Arati, and it spurred her to run for Glen Rockâ€™s Borough Council in 2017. She won, becoming the first South Asian elected to the council. Arati has made the climate crisis a priority, leading a successful charge for town-wide clean energy consumption and a plastic bag ban.</p>

<p> 
As a medical researcher whose husband treats patients daily, Arati sees the need for healthcare for all. As a scientist, she understands the urgency of adopting bold action to address climate change. And as an activist, she's seen first-hand the corrupting influence of corporate money on government.
</p>

<p> Arati is running for Congress not only because her representative doesn't honor those values, but because we live in an exceptional moment and need bold progressive leadership.</p>
