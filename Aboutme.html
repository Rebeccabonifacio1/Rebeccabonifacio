  <h1> About Me </h1>
</header>
<main> 
<body> 
    <p>  I am a current undergraduate in my third year at James Madison University. I'm a double major studying <a href=https://www.jmu.edu/smad/ target=_blank> Media Arts and Design </a> and <a href=https://www.jmu.edu/commstudies/ target=_blank> Communication Studies </a>. Within my programs of study, I have concentrations in Journalism, Advocacy Studies and Pre-Law, as well as a minor in Political Communication. My experience at James Madison University has been highlighted by my outside involvements. Throughout my time at JMU, I have had the honor of serving my university through being a <a href=https://www.facebook.com/jmustudentambassadors/ target=_blank> Student Ambassador </a>, an organization that offers volunteer campus tours to prospective families and students. This organization has helped me grow into the best version of myself. I have become someone who can recognize the good and bad within their involvements and work to fix the things that they don't agree with. I have served in many leadership roles in this organization, but most memorably, I worked on the <a href=https://jmusa.weebly.com/executive-council/ target=_blank> 2019 Executive Board </a> as Historian. This position focused on our organization's public image, and I was responsible for providing videography and photography services, making merchandise, and running our organization's <a href=https://www.instagram.com/jmu_ambassadors/ target=_blank> social media </a>. </p>

        <div class="text"> Student Ambassadors 2019 </div></div>
    </div>
    <p> My involvements outside of Student Ambassadors vary tremendously, from being in <a href=https://beinvolved.jmu.edu/organization/phialphadelta/ target=_blank> Phi Alpha Delta,</a> a pre-law, professional fraternity, to being a member of <a href=https://beinvolved.jmu.edu/organization/EDM/ target=_blank> EDM Club,</a> an organization that focuses solely on love and appreciation for Electronic Dance Music. I even have a radio show called Radio 51 on JMU's local college station,<a href=http://wxjm.org/about/ target=_blank> WXJM,</a> where my roommate and I discuss different conspiracies! Overall, I am somebody who works hard to find the aspects of life that might go unnoticed and revel in originality. I am a creative who is constantly looking for new ways to express this urge. I love travel, spring, the smell of the earth after it rains, and anything nostalgic. At my very core, I'm still figuring it all out and have difficulty describing who I am and who I want to become, but it's all part of the journey.  </p>
