    <h1> Redesign Proposal</h1>
    </header>
    <p> For my Redesign project, I have chosen to recreate <a href=https://www.aratiforcongress.com/ target=_blank> Dr. Arati Kreibich’s Democrat For Congress website </a>. Arati is currently running for NJ-5’s primary campaign to unseat Democratic Congressman Josh Gottheimer. Personally, I support Dr. Kreibich’s policies and am a Communications Intern for her campaign. However, as someone who understands the importance of web design to get out an overall message, I think that her website could use some work. There is a great deal that I intend to change, but some of my main concerns are the color schemes and font choices, homepage organization and the repetitiveness of content. Ultimately, the audience, as it currently stands, is voters within NJ-5’s congressional districts, as well as potential volunteers and other political figures who have similar voting patterns to Dr. Kreibich. </p>
